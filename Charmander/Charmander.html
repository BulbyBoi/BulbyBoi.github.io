           Charmander (ヒトカゲ) #0004
         </h1>
        
        
        <p>
    Charmander was designed by Atsuko Nishida, one of the character designers for Pocket Monsters Red and Blue.  
     </p>
<p>It first served as the first generation games' fire starter Pokemon (Red and Blue). Its japanese name <I>Hitokage</I> literally means salamander. It has prominent reptillian appearance and its iconic final evolution sports a draconic look. Both it and its final evolution shares the same color. However, Charmeleon, its next form, has a darker shade.</p>
